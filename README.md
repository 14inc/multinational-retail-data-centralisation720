# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

I have learnt how to edit markdowns and design object oriented programs using the Python programming language as result of working on this project.

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
- Ensure that you have the following packages installed: git, pip, python3 and conda.
- On your terminal, run `git clone https://github.com/14inc/hangman963.git` to download the project repo to your local machine
- Navigate to the hangman subdirectory using the `cd hangman963/hangman` 
- Run `python3 filename.py` for any of the milestone_*.py files in the directory.
- **NB:** milestone_5.py is the most advanced implementation of the hangman game implemented as per the instructions.

## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
On your Terminal, run <code>python3 milestone_2.py</code>

Also, run <code>python3 milestone_3.py</code> to see the version of this solution that incorporates the use of Python functions.

Next, run <code>python3 milestone_4.py</code> to see the version of this solution that incorporates the use of Python classes. It also offers more feedback to the user that helps their guessing. An infinite loop is implemented so you man need to press `CTRL + C` to exit the running program. Please do likewise with *milestone_5.py*

Finally, run <code>python3 milestone_5.py</code> to see the final version of this solution that ties all concepts used together. Please note that it has limitations that makes it run in an infinite loop. This is as a result of the instructions provided in the project guidance.

Feel free to edit the code to remove these limitations
